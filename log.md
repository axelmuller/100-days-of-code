### Day 1: 05/20/2020

*Today's Progress: I sorted out a bug in my header processing script and created a postgresql table to store the data in. I was also able to connect my postgres database to python using psycopg2

*Thoughts:* querying a 9GB dataframe with pandas is very slow, at least on my laptop. I hope postgresql will speed up the process.
