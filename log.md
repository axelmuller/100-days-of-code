# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 05/19/2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to join the 100 Days of Code today
I will try to spend most of the time working on data science projects 

**Thoughts:**  


**Link to work:** 

### Day 1: 05/20/2020

*Today's Progress*: I sorted out a bug in my header processing script and created a postgresql table to store the data in. I was also able to connect my postgres database to python using psycopg2

*Thoughts:* querying a 9GB dataframe with pandas is very slow, at least on my laptop. I hope postgresql will speed up the process.

### Day 2: 05/21/2020

*Today's Progress:* I created queries in postgres to yield new tables that I can use for my analysis in pandas. 

*Thoughts:* doing the aggregation in postgres is much quicker than in pandas. creating the white player table for 73 million games took just 5 minutes on my laptop.
